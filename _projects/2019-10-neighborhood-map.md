## Project Description

This project is a single-page application that I created using React and that features a map of a neighborhood. I then added additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular restaurants in the neighborhood, a search function to easily discover these restaurants, and a list view to support simple browsing of all locations. I then implemented third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these restaurants. All application components render on-screen in a responsive manner, follow accessibility rules and is available offline.

Overall, the application's interface is really intuitive to use making the experience straightforward for any user.

Summary of the tools and technologies used:

* React
* API servers
* Asynchronous Programming
* Responsive designs
* Web accessibility
* Service Worker


You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:

> “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”

### Image galleries

Here's a a gallery showing some of the app's features:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/neighborhood-map/nbhm-1.jpg">
	<img src="/images/neighborhood-map/nbhm-2.jpg">
	<img src="/images/neighborhood-map/nbhm-3.jpg">
</div>

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

```html
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>
```

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.

### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/neighborhood-map/nbhm-2.jpg">
	<img src="/images/neighborhood-map/nbhm-3.jpg">
</div>
